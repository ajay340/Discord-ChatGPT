This is a self-hosted Discord bot for communicating with OpenAI's completion model

*NOTE*: There is not an official/unoffical API for ChatGPT so this Discord bot is using the Davinci completion model

Have the following environment variables before running the bot
```
BOT_TOKEN # Discord Bot Token
OPENAI_API_KEY # OpenAI API Key
```

Use the `/chat` command to interact with the Model
